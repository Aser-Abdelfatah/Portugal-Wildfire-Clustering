# Portugal-Wildfire-Clustering
This is the open-source repo for my wildfire clustering research done at University of Lausanne during summer 2023 as a part of Beucler Lab and in collaboration with Dr. Marj Tonini

## Work reproducibility:
The data is located in Portugal_Dataset_Extraction/Datasets. There are six datasets, three for unburned areas and three for burned areas. For either burned or non-burned data, one dataset includes meteorological data, one dataset include both meteorological and climatic data, and a third dataset includes meteorological and climatic data in addition to imputated data for missing values. The climatic data is computed as the average of the meteorological data over the entire time frame of the source data cube.
</br> The code used to extract the burned dataset is located in Portugal_Dataset_Extraction/Extraction_of_Burned_Data, and the code used to extract the non-burned dataset is located in Portugal_Dataset_Extraction/Extraction_of_Non-burned_Data.
